        Share is a totally transparent, direct-democratic skill-sharing platform where you can help your community,
        build your reputation and learn some brand new skills! If you've ever wanted legal advice but not wanted to 
        pay for it, needed therapy but been unable to get an appointment, or just wanted some help with your university 
        project or work presentation, Share is the solution for you! Our win-win-win model promises to return value to 
        Volunteers, Users and Sponsors by transforming work into social capital and creating a Wikipedia-like challenge 
        to the standard economy of exchange. Built on a commitment to the idea that social exchange has real material 
        value, Share is a tool to empower your community, boost your profile and create some real value in the world.
